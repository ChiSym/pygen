Selection API
=============

- ChoiceSelection(addr1, addr2, addr3) with alias select

- __or__(self, other: ChoiceSelection) -> ChoiceSelection

- __and__(self, other: ChoiceSelection) -> ChoiceSelection

- __neg__(self) -> ChoiceSelection

- __contains__(self, address: ChoiceAddress) -> bool

- get_subselection(self, address: ChoiceAddress, strict=True) -> ChoiceSelection

    note: this should always succeed when strict=False, even if this is a complement

- is_iterable(self) -> bool

    returns true if and only if __iter__ is guaranteed not to crash

- __iter__(self)

    returns an iterator over (single-element-address, selection) pairs

    note: this will crash if self is not iterable, but should succeed otherwise
