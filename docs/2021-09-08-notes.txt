# Addresses

There will be a new Python `pygen.Address` class

`Address`es are immutable

`Address`es are hashable (store the hash in the object)

There is a shorthand `pygen.addr` helper-constructor that can be used: `addr("a", "b", "c")`; `addr()` is used to construct the empty address; `addr("")` is not the empty address.

An address may be the 'empty address' (semantically equivalent to `()` if addresses were tuples).

Testing if an address is the empty address is done with the Pythonic expression `if a`. This is semantically equivalent to `a is ()` if addresses were tuples.

Getting the first element of an address via a `first()` method (semantically equivalent to `a[0]` or error if `a is ()`; if addresses were tuples).

Getting the rest (another `Address`)  via a `rest()` method (semantically, equivalent to `a[1:]` or error if `a is ()`; if addresses were tuples).

Override `len(a)`

Implementation notes: there are a few possible internal representations one can use for addresses:

tuples:
```
("a", "b", "c")
("a", "b", ("c", "d"))
("a", "b", "c", "d")
```
which has O(n) `rest()` implementation where n is the depth of the address

Gen.jl essentially uses a linked list:
```
("a", ("b", ("c",))) 
("a", ("b", ("c", "d")))
("a", ("b", ("c", ("d",))))
```
which has O(1) `rest()` implementation.

# Syntax for invoking traced code in DML

`gentrace(other_dml_function, (0, 1), None)` equivalent to @trace(other_dml_function(0, 1)) in Gen.jl

`gentrace(normal, (0, 1), "a")` equivalent to `gentrace(normal, (0, 1), ("a",))`

`gentrace(normal, (0, 1), ())` is supported, but if the callee is not a DML generative function then it must be the only traced call in the whole generative function
    1.123

`gentrace(normal, (0, 1), ("a",))`
    "a" - 1.123

`gentrace(normal, (0, 1), ("a", "b"))`
    ("a", "b") - 1.123

`gentrace(normal, (0, 1), (("a", "b"),))` is 'discouraged' but still possible
    ("a", "b")
         |
         |-1 : 1.1233
         |-2 : 1.12313
         |-3 : 1.12313

`gentrace(normal, (0, 1), ("a", "b"))
    "a"
    |
    |--- "b"
         |
         |-1 : 1.1233
         |-2 : 1.12313
         |-3 : 1.12313

In Gen.jl currently, @trace(feras_mvnormal(..), :a => :b)
    :a
    |
    |--- :b
         |
         |-1 : 1.1233
         |-2 : 1.12313
         |-3 : 1.12313


# Possible syntax improvements

Is it possible to remove the `gentrace` keyword or equivalent entirely? e.g.:

    other_generative_function(0, 1, addr="asdf")

    normal(0, 1, addr="asdf")

closer to an embedded language, because it doesnt have 'gentrace'

# Unlike Gen.jl, primitive distributions are also generative functions

A 'primitive distribution' is a generative function that:

- always samples a value at the empty address

- the return value is always the value at the empty address

Note that it is possible to implement primitive distributions by writing regular generative functions, as long as they conform to those rules.

# Choice tries

We should rename 'ChoiceMaps' to 'ChoiceTrie'.

`ChoiceTrie` will have a `flatten()` method that returns a 'ChoiceDict' or a Python `dict` (see below)

Standard recursive walking pattern:

    def my_walker(trie):
        for (k, sub_trie) in trie.items():
            if sub_trie.is_primitive():
                value = subtrie[] # error if it is not primitive
                .. do stuff ..
            else:
                result = my_walker(sub_trie)
                .. do stuff ..

The getindex method removes noise of empty addresses for the user:

    assert trie["a"] == 1.123 # where trie = {"a": {(): 1.123}}

Due to the noise-removal, there would be an ambiguity for the user, but this ambiguity is removed by providing an `is_primitive(addr)` method:

    trie = {"b" : {"a" : {(): 1.123}}}
    assert not trie.is_primitive("b")
    assert trie["b"] == {"a" : {(): 1.123}} # this is a submap

    trie = {"b" : {(): {"a" : {(): 1.123}}}}
    assert trie.is_primitive("b")
    assert trie["b"] == {"a" : {(): 1.123}} # this is a choice

Starter implementation:

    class ChoiceTrie:
        
        def __init__(self):
            self.dict = {}

        def is_primitive(self, addr):
            # TODO check if the submap at address is a primitive choice map or not

        def num_choices(self):
            # TODO for immutable, cache it
            if self.is_primitive():
                return 1
            else:
                total = 0
                for (k, sub_trie) in self.dict.items():
                    total += sub_trie.num_choices()
                return total

        # indexing into a choice map means either retreiving the submap (if the
        # sub-choice-trie is not primtive) or the value (if it is primitive)
        def getindex(self, addr):
            subtrie = self.dict[addr]
            assert isinstance(subtrie, ChoiceTrie)
            if subtrie.is_primitive():
                return subtrie.dict[()]
            else:
                return subtrie

        def get_primitives(self):
            # TODO dict.items() iterator, like get_values_shallow() in Gen.jl

        def get_submaps(self):
            # TODO dict.items() iterator, like get_submaps_shallow() in Gen.jl

        def flatten(self):
            # TODO returns a Python dictionary, or an object (ChoiceDict) that
            # has the same interface as a dictionary view, where keys are
            # multi-part addresses

Iteration is 

To iterate over all the random choices in a choice trie:

    for (k, v) in trie.flatten().items():
        # ...

There may be some other methods also (e.g. to_array and from_array?)

'Mutable choice maps'

    cm = choicemap() in Gen.jl
    cm[:a] = 1
    cm.set_value!
    cm.set_submap!

'choice maps that come from trace.get_choices()'
views onto the trace data structure

    m = choicemap(
        (:a => :b => :c, 5.0))

    m = choicemap()
    m[:a => :b => :c] = 5.0

    m[:a => :b => :c]

    set_submap!

# ChoiceSelection API

    s = select(("a", "b"), ("a", "c"), "d")
    {("a", "b", ...)} U {("a", "c", ...)} U {("d", ...)}

the definition of s[.] 

    s["a"]
    {("b", ...)} U {("c", ...)}

complement(s)

    ({("a", "b", ...)} U {("a", "c", ...)} U {("d", ...)})^C

    complement(s)["a"] = complement(s["a"])

selections are sets of addresses?

current issue in Gen.jl:
    
    @gen function foo(x)
        y ~ normal(x, 1)
        return y
    end

    bar = Map(foo)

    Gen.regenerate(bar, ([1, 2, 3],), select(1 => :y))

    Gen.regenerate(bar, ([1, 2, 3],), complement(select(1 => :y))) # this will currently crash

    Gen.regenerate(bar, ([1, 2, 3],), AllSelection())
