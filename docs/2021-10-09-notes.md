types of users:

1. users who implement GenFn (GFI) themselves ---- GFI

2. users who implement their own inference algorithms

there could be interfaces for inference templates, that capture the high-level input/output behavior of inference processes.
examples:

    Built-in inferrence library has an init method that allows the user to use Ray or not.

    There could be distributed and non-distributed vereion of each

    InferenceEngine abstract class
    traces, weights = infer(constraints)
    
    SequentialInferenceEngine abstract class
    stateful
    state.add_data(constraints)
    state.get_current_beliefs() -> traces, weights
    
    VectorizedInferenceEngine
    list of list of traces, .. = infer(list_of_constraints)
    



4. users who use existing algorithm implementations
   (maybe with their own proposals)

5. users who use existing algorithm implementations
   without any customization
